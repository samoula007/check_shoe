The aim of the project is to get a mail whenever the wanted size of a specific shoe on the nike website is available.


The sender email I used is from https://app.mailgun.com/. Setting up an account is free.
If you want to run it too, I suggest you use https://replit.com/ to host your program. You can also use https://uptimerobot.com/
to keep your program alive (make it run 24/7).

Note that the sender's address is directly going to spam. I used this website to solve my problem:

If you need any help setting it up, please contact me at: guccirarezki@gmail.com
